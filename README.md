Django consist of a main project that has several “apps” inside of it 


Just like spring boot Django also has views(think HTML) and routing that work almost the same way 

Additionally for the less experienced Django takes some of the heavy lifting out when it comes to creating tables and models. 

These “migrations” do most of the work for you and are stored in each independent apps init.py file

Django has an admin site where you can sign in after creating a super user and manage the data in your database (simple management) without connecting through a database management system. 

Additionally you can create sub roles and grant permissions to others on what level of access/permissions they have.
